# MicroPython Pico-Clock-Green example

Python port of the C code for the Waveshare [Pico-Clock-Green](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-Clock-Green) product.

  core functionality of the clock (alarms/time setting, etc) remains to be
  implemented.

## Instructions (Linux)
* Flash MicroPython onto the Pico.
* Install `ampy` from AdaFruit.
* Execute the `run` bash script to upload Python files and execute
  main.py

## Instructions (Windows)
If not running on Linux, use your usual method for uploading code to the Pico.
